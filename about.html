            <p>FuelCanBurner is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to calculate fuel consumption and costs based on distance, fuel efficiency, and fuel price.</p>
            <p>It helps users estimate their fuel requirements for different journeys, enabling them to plan their trips more efficiently.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore the various features and calculators available on the website!</p>
            <h3>How to Use the Fuel Consumption Calculator:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Enter Inputs:</strong> Start by entering the distance of your journey, fuel efficiency of your vehicle, and the current fuel price per liter in the respective input fields.</li>
                <li><strong>Click Calculate:</strong> After entering all the required inputs, click on the "Calculate" button. This will trigger the calculation function, which will compute the required fuel and its cost based on your inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Outputs:</strong> Once the calculation is complete, review the outputs displayed below the input fields. The "Fuel Needed" output tells you how much fuel you'll require for your journey, and the "Cost of Fuel" output indicates the total cost of that fuel.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust Inputs (Optional):</strong> If you want to calculate fuel requirements for different distances or under different fuel efficiency assumptions, you can adjust the input values and click "Calculate" again to get updated results.</li>
            </ol>
